  {
    question: 'Is my phone number visible to others?',
    answer: 'No, your number remains private.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need WhatsApp installed?',
    answer: 'Yes, both the vehicle owner and the reporter should have WhatsApp.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my phone number visible to the person scanning my QR code?',
    answer: "No. We use WhatsApp's Click-to-Chat feature, which allows others to message you without revealing your phone number. Your privacy is always protected."
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens when someone scans the QR code?',
    answer: "They'll be redirected to WhatsApp with a pre-filled message like: 'Hi, your vehicle is parked in a way that's causing an issue. Could you please move it?' They can send the message directly â€” no need to know your number or app download required."
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to install any app?',
    answer: "No. All you need is WhatsApp installed on your phone. There's no need for any additional apps."
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I customize the message that people send me?',
    answer: 'No.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if someone misuses the QR code?',
    answer: 'Each scan initiates a real-time WhatsApp chat. We also log scan activity to detect abuse and can blacklist misused QR codes.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need internet access to scan or receive messages?',
    answer: 'Yes. The person scanning must have an internet connection to open the WhatsApp chat, and you need one to receive messages on WhatsApp.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use this on multiple vehicles?',
    answer: 'Yes! Total 3 vehicles can be linked to a whatsapp contact number.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I add more than one contact for a vehicle?',
    answer: "Currently, we support one contact per QR code. If you'd like to assign a backup contact (e.g., family member or driver), that's a feature coming soon in our roadmap."
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this service available internationally?',
    answer: 'No. Right now this service is available in India only.'
